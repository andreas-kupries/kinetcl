<p>Welcome to KineTcl, a binding of the OpenNI framework providing
Tcl with access to MS Kinect (tm), and related sensor systems.</p>
<p>The audience of this document is anyone wishing to build the
packages, for either themselves, or others.</p>
<p>For a developer intending to extend or modify the packages we
additionally provide</p>
<ol class="enumerated">
<li><p><i class="term"><a href="license.html">KineTcl - License</a></i>.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="term"><a href="kinetcl_devguide.html">KineTcl - The Developer's Guide</a></i>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Please read <i class="term"><a href="kinetcl_sources.html">KineTcl - How To Get The Sources</a></i> first, if that was
not done already. Here we assume that the sources are already
available in a directory of your choice.</p>
</div>
<div id="section2" class="section"><h2><a name="section2">Requisites</a></h2>
<p>Before KineTcl can be build and used a number of requisites must be installed. These are:</p>
<ol class="enumerated">
<li><p>The scripting language Tcl.
       For details see <span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection1">Tcl</a></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b class="package">critcl</b> package (C embedding) for <b class="syscmd">Tcl</b>.
       For details see <span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection2">CriTcl</a></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b class="package">crimp</b> package (image processing) for <b class="syscmd">Tcl</b>.
       For details see <span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection3">Crimp</a></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The OpenNI framework.
       For details see <span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection4">OpenNI</a></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The PrimeSense NITE algorithm package for the OpenNI framework.
       For details see <span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection5">NITE</a></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>An OpenNI sensor library for your Sensor device.
       For details see <span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection6">Sensors</a></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b class="package">kettle</b> application (Build tool) for <b class="syscmd">Tcl</b>.
       For details see <span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection7">Kettle</a></span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This list assumes that the machine where KineTcl is to be installed is
essentially clean. Of course, if parts of the dependencies listed
below are already installed the associated steps can be skipped. It is
still recommended to read their sections though, to validate that the
dependencies they talk about are indeed installed.</p>
<div id="subsection1" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection1">Tcl</a></h3>
<p>As we are building a Tcl package that should be pretty much obvious
that a working Tcl installation is needed, and I will not belabor the
point.</p>
<p>Out of the many use whatever you are comfortable with, as long
as it provides Tcl 8.5, or higher, and Tk 8.5 or higher.</p>
<p>This may a Tcl installation provided by your operating system
distribution, from a distribution-independent vendor, or built by
yurself.</p>
<p>Myself, I used <a href="http://www.activestate.com">ActiveState's</a>
ActiveTcl 8.5 distribution during development of the binding, as I am
most familiar with it.</p>
<p><em>(Disclosure: I, Andreas Kupries, work for ActiveState, maintaining ActiveTcl and TclDevKit for them).</em></p>
<p>This distribution can be found at
<a href="http://www.activestate.com/activetcl">http://www.activestate.com/activetcl</a>. Retrieve the archive of
ActiveTcl 8.5 for your platform and install it as directed by
ActiveState.</p>
<p>Assuming that ActiveTcl got installed I usually run the command</p>
<pre class="example">
    teacup update
</pre>
<p>to install all packages ActiveState provides, and the kitchensink, as
the distribution itself usually contains only the ost important set of
packages. This ensures that the dependencies for <span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection2">CriTcl</a></span>,
<span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection3">Crimp</a></span>, and KineTcl are all present, and more.</p>
<p>If that is not your liking you have to read the sections 
for <span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection2">CriTcl</a></span>, <span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection3">Crimp</a></span>, and KineTcl to determine the
exact set of packages required, and install only these using</p>
<pre class="example">
    teacup install $packagename
</pre>
<p>Both <b class="syscmd">teacup</b> commands above assume that ActiveState's
TEApot repository at <a href="http://teapot.activestate.com">http://teapot.activestate.com</a> is in the
list of repositories accessible to <b class="syscmd">teacup</b>. This is automatically
ensured for the ActiveTcl distribution. Others may have to run</p>
<pre class="example">
    teacup archive add http://teapot.activestate.com
</pre>
<p>to make this happen.</p>
<p>For those wishing to build Tcl/Tk on their own, their sources
can be found at</p>
<dl class="definitions">
<dt>Tcl</dt>
<dd><p><a href="http://core.tcl.tk/tcl/">http://core.tcl.tk/tcl/</a></p></dd>
<dt>Tk</dt>
<dd><p><a href="http://core.tcl.tk/tk/">http://core.tcl.tk/tk/</a></p></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div id="subsection2" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection2">CriTcl</a></h3>
<p>To build both <span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection3">Crimp</a></span>, and KineTcl the tool <b class="syscmd">critcl</b> is
required.</p>
<p>Both Crimp's and KineTcl's build systems accept it either as an
application found in the PATH, or as a Tcl package available to the
<b class="syscmd">tclsh</b> used to run their build &amp; installation processes.</p>
<p>While <span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection3">Crimp</a></span> just requires version 3 or higher KineTcl
itself <em>must</em> have version 3.1 or higher. Either is found in
CriTcl's github repository.</p>
<p>This github repository can be found at
<a href="http://andreas-kupries.github.com/critcl">http://andreas-kupries.github.com/critcl</a>.</p>
<p>The relevant repository branch is <em>master</em>. Do not try to
use other branches, these usually contain features, experiments or
bugfixes in progress, and as such are not stable.</p>
<p>Please make sure to use at least commit [fe814d4977], or
later.</p>
<p>At the above url is also an explanation on how to build and
install CriTcl, including a list of its dependencies.</p>
<p>Its instructions will not be repeated here. If there are
problems with their directions please file a bug against the critcl
project, and not KineTcl.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection3" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection3">Crimp</a></h3>
<p>To build and use KineTcl the image processing package <b class="package">crimp</b>
is required.</p>
<p>This package must be available to the <b class="syscmd">tclsh</b> used to
run KineTcl's build &amp; installation process, and the <b class="syscmd">tclsh</b>
used to run scripts requiring KineTcl.</p>
<p>KineTcl <em>must</em> have access to revision [795374375f]
of Crimp fossil reository, or later. Earlier revisions do not provide
all the operations used by KineTcl.</p>
<p>This fossil repository can be found at
<a href="http://chiselapp.com/user/andreas_kupries/repository/crimp/home">http://chiselapp.com/user/andreas_kupries/repository/crimp/home</a>.</p>
<p>The relevant repository branch is <em>trunk</em>.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While the ActiveState TEApot repository provides
all crimp packages for installation, this is not enough for building
KineTcl, only running it later. The header files required to build
KineTcl are not provided by the packages in the TEApot. This is why
Crimp's sources have to be retrieved from its fossil repository and
build locally.</p>
<p>Crimp has a build and installation guide much like this one for
KineTcl, which can be found at the above site and explains how to
retrieve its sources and build the package, which dependencies are
required, etc. The direct link to this guide is
<a href="http://chiselapp.com/user/andreas_kupries/repository/crimp/doc/tip/embedded/www/doc/files/crimp_installer.html">http://chiselapp.com/user/andreas_kupries/repository/crimp/doc/tip/embedded/www/doc/files/crimp_installer.html</a></p>
<p>Its instructions will not be repeated here. If there are
problems with their directions please file a bug against the crimp
project, and not KineTcl.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection4" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection4">OpenNI</a></h3>
<p>KineTcl is, despite its name, not a direct binding to the Kinect
itself. It actually is a binding to the more general OpenNI framework
(version 1). This framework provides a set of generic APIs for
sensors, processing algorithms, and applications into which anything
following these APIs can be plugged into.</p>
<p>PrimeSense, the maker of the 3D sensor found in the Kinect is a
main member of the OpenNI organization managing the framework and
provides plugins for its sensor and various analysis algorithms.</p>
<p>The OpenNI binaries must be installed to build and use KineTcl.</p>
<p>These binaries can be found at
<a href="http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx">http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx</a></p>
<p>References to the sources of the frameork, should you wish to
build them by yourself, can be found at
<a href="http://www.openni.org/Downloads.aspx">http://www.openni.org/Downloads.aspx</a>. When doing so please
follow their instructions on building the package.  If there are
problems with their directions please file a bug against the OpenNI
project, and not KineTcl.</p>
<p>Development was done against the binaries of OpenNI version
1.5.2.23. After downloading the binaries were installed by unpacking
the tarball and then running the provided installation script. I.e.:</p>
<pre class="example">
	 bunzip2 &lt; openni-bin-dev-linux-x64-v1.5.2.23.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
	 cd OpenNI-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.2.23
	 # !Edit the headers to work around the bug mentioned below.
	 sudo ./install.sh
	 # Note the sudo above, this script installs binaries into
	 # root owned directories.
</pre>
<p>Note that version 1.5.2.23 has a bug in its headers.
To work around this bug the provided header files have to be modified,
<em>before</em> installing them.</p>
<p>Open the header file &quot;<b class="file">XnModuleInterface.h</b>&quot; in the editor
of your choice and look for the declaration of</p>
<pre class="example">
     typedef struct XnModuleExportedProductionNodeInterface {
     	     ...
     } XnModuleExportedProductionNodeInterface;
</pre>
<p>Rewrite the end of this declaration to</p>
<pre class="example">
     typedef struct XnModuleExportedProductionNodeInterface {
     	     ...
     } ;
</pre>
<p>This removes a conflict between this declaration and its forward
declaration in the header file &quot;<b class="file">XnTypes.h</b>&quot;.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection5" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection5">NITE</a></h3>
<p>OpenNI (the organization) recommends to install the PrimeSense
NITE binaries, which provide various higher-level analysis
algorithms.</p>
<p>For KineTcl we not only recommend but demand installation. It
is the algorithms in NITE which provide user detection and skeleton
tracking, i.e. all the interesting higher-level features we want.</p>
<p>These binaries can be found at
<a href="http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx">http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx</a></p>
<p>In contrast to the OpenNI framework itself NITE seems to be
closed-source, and no references to a source repository are available.</p>
<p>During development NITE version 1.5.2.21 was installed.
After downloading the binaries were installed by unpacking the
tarball and then running the provided installation script. I.e.:</p>
<pre class="example">
	 bunzip2 &lt; nite-bin-linux-x64-v1.5.2.21.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
	 cd NITE-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.2.21
	 sudo ./install.sh
	 # Note the sudo above, this script installs binaries into
	 # root owned directories.
</pre>
</div>
<div id="subsection6" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection6">Sensors</a></h3>
<p>When actually using a Kinect the OpenNI framework alone is not enough.</p>
<p>We have to install the drivers for our sensor device as well.</p>
<p>Please note that the Sensor driver binaries available at
<a href="http://www.openni.org/Downloads.aspx">http://www.openni.org/Downloads.aspx</a> are only generic to devices
using PrimeSense's sensor and are <em>not</em> adapted to specific
devices like MS Kinect. <em>Do not install these</em>, but whatever is
available for your specific device.</p>
<p>For MS Kinect the sources of the specific sensor driver are
found at <a href="https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect">https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect</a>.</p>
<p>This repository also contain prebuilt binaries for various
platforms, which were used during development of the binding. Should
you wish to build the sensor driver by yourself, please follow their
instructions on building the package.  If there are problems with
their directions please file a bug against the SensorKinect project,
and not KineTcl.</p>
<p>Development was done against the binaries of SensorKinect
version 5.1.0.25. After downloading the binaries were installed by
unpacking the tarball and then running the provided installation
script. I.e.:</p>
<pre class="example">
	 bunzip2 &lt; SensorKinect091-Bin-Linux64-v5.1.0.25.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
	 cd SensorKinect091-Bin-Linux64-v5.1.0.25
	 sudo ./install.sh
	 # Note the sudo above, this script installs binaries into
	 # root owned directories.
</pre>
<p>On a specific note, one of the files installed is
&quot;<b class="file">Install/55-primesense-usb.rules</b>&quot;
which is placed into &quot;<b class="file">/etc/udev/rules.d</b>&quot;.</p>
<p>This file contains the udev rules which enable access to the
usb sensor devices by non-root users.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection7" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection7">Kettle</a></h3>
<p>To build KineTcl the tool <b class="syscmd">kettle</b> is required.</p>
<p>KineTcl's build system requires it as an application found
in the PATH.</p>
<p>KineTcl requires version 1 or higher.</p>
<p>The fossil repository providing releases of this tool (and its
associated package) can be found at
<a href="http://core.tcl.tk/akupries/kettle">http://core.tcl.tk/akupries/kettle</a>.</p>
<p>A mirror of the repository can be found at
<a href="https://chiselapp.com/user/andreas_kupries/repository/Kettle">https://chiselapp.com/user/andreas_kupries/repository/Kettle</a>.</p>
<p>Use of either releases or of the head of the main branch is
recommended. Usage of branches is strongly discouraged as these are
used to work on experimental features and bugfixes of the tool. As
such their stability is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>At the above url is also an explanation on how to build and
install Kettle, including a list of its dependencies.</p>
<p>Its instructions will not be repeated here. If there are
problems with their directions please file a bug against the Kettle
project, and not KineTcl.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section3" class="section"><h2><a name="section3">Build &amp; Installation Instructions</a></h2>
<div id="subsection8" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection8">Build &amp; Installation (Unix)</a></h3>
<p>This section describes the actions required to install KineTcl on Unix
systems (Linux, BSD, and related, including OS X).
If you have to install KineTcl on a Windows machine see section
<span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection9">Build &amp; Installation (Windows)</a></span> instead.</p>
<p>To install KineTcl simply run</p>
<pre class="example">
    /path/to/tclsh8.5 /path/to/kinetcl/build.tcl install
</pre>
<p>where &quot;<b class="file">/path/to/tclsh8.5</b>&quot; is the tclsh of your Tcl installation, and
&quot;<b class="file">/path/to/kinetcl</b>&quot; the location of the KineTcl sources on your system.</p>
<p>This builds all packages and then places them in a directory where the
<b class="cmd">tclsh8.5</b> will find them.</p>
<p>The build system provides a small GUI for those not comfortable with
the command line.
This GUI is accessible by invoking &quot;<b class="file">build.tcl</b>&quot; without any
arguments.</p>
<p>To get help about the methods of &quot;<b class="file">build.tcl</b>&quot;, and their complete
syntax, invoke &quot;<b class="file">build.tcl</b>&quot; with argument <b class="method">help</b>, i.e.,
like</p>
<pre class="example">
    /path/to/tclsh8.5 /path/to/kinetcl/build.tcl help
</pre>
</div>
<div id="subsection9" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection9">Build &amp; Installation (Windows)</a></h3>
<p>This section describes the actions required to install KineTcl on Windows(tm)
systems.
If you have to install KineTcl on a Unix machine (Linux, BSD, and
related, including OS X) see section
<span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection8">Build &amp; Installation (Unix)</a></span> instead.</p>
<p>To install KineTcl simply run</p>
<pre class="example">
    /path/to/tclsh8.5 /path/to/kettle -f /path/to/kinetcl/build.tcl install
</pre>
<p>where &quot;<b class="file">/path/to/tclsh8.5</b>&quot; is the tclsh of your Tcl installation,
&quot;<b class="file">/path/to/kettle</b>&quot; is the installed <b class="syscmd">kettle</b> application,
and &quot;<b class="file">/path/to/kinetcl</b>&quot; the location of the KineTcl sources on your
system.</p>
<p>This builds all packages and then places them in a directory where the
<b class="cmd">tclsh8.5</b> will find them.</p>
<p>The above is written without assuming any associations from
extensions (like &quot;<b class="file">.tcl</b>&quot;) to executables responsible for the file
with that extension.
Actually, given that &quot;<b class="file">build.tcl</b>&quot; is technically a
&quot;<b class="file">kettle</b>&quot;-script, which in turn is a &quot;<b class="file">.tcl</b>&quot;-script I am not
sure if Windows is able to handle such a chain of interpreters.
The command given above simply spells out the entire chain.</p>
<p>The build system provides a small GUI for those not comfortable with
the command line.
This GUI is accessible by invoking &quot;<b class="file">build.tcl</b>&quot; without any
arguments from the command line, or by invoking it through a
double-click on the &quot;<b class="file">build.tcl</b>&quot; in a file explorer window.</p>
<p>To get help about the methods of &quot;<b class="file">build.tcl</b>&quot;, and their complete
syntax, invoke &quot;<b class="file">build.tcl</b>&quot; with argument <b class="method">help</b>, i.e.,
like</p>
<pre class="example">
